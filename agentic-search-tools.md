# Agentic Search Tools

* If the agent sends a query to search tool, it would first understand the question and divide it into sub questions if needed
* For each subquery, search tool will have to find the best source
* It will get the results, rank and filter the results and result top-k results

Code:

* The result returned is now how human would want it but its exactly how agents needs it

```python
### Agentic Search
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from tavily import TavilyClient

# load environment variables from .env file
_ = load_dotenv()

# connect
client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.environ.get("TAVILY_API_KEY"))

# run search
result = client.search("What is in Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU?",
                       include_answer=True)

# print the answer
result["answer"]
# 'The new Blackwell GPU uses the TSMC 4NP node and GDDR7 memory. 
# It features advanced architecture for AI and high-performance computing.
# Blackwell GPUs are designed for next-generation computing tasks.'


### Resgular Search
# choose location (try to change to your own city!)

city = "San Francisco"

query = f"""
    what is the current weather in {city}?
    Should I travel there today?
    "weather.com"
"""

# If we use duckduckgo to get URL
# Then scrape it and pass it to LLM to get results then we might result like
# Recent Locations Weather Forecasts Radar & Maps ......

# If we do using agentic search
result = client.search(query, max_results=1)

# print first result
data = result["results"][0]["content"]

print(data)
# {
