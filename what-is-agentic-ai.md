# What is Agentic AI

**Non Agentic workflow:**

* Essay on topic X from start to finish in one go, without using backspace



**Agentic workflow:**

* Process where an LLM based app executes multiple steps to complete a task&#x20;
* Write an essay outline on topic X ⇒ LLM
* Do you need any web research ⇒ LLM + Websearch
* Write a first draft ⇒ LLM
* Consider what parts need revision or more research ⇒ LLM + Human request review
* Revise your draft ⇒ LLM



* It thinks/does research
* then again revises and so on
* So agentic workflow can take longer, but delivers much better results
