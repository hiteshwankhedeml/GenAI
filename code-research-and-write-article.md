# ðŸŸ¢ Code - Research and write article

* &#x20;We can use different LLM, bydefault it use openai gpt 4
* Crew puts agents and tasks together so that they operate as an unit
* Bydefault crew executes tasks sequentially, so we need to give the correct order
* You should focus on goals and expectations
* One agent can do multiple tasks
* Tasks and agents should be granular

Creating Agent:

* Define your Agents, and provide them a `role`, `goal` and `backstory`.
* It has been seen that LLMs perform better when they are role playing

<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Steps:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">We define an agent, we specify it's role, goal and backstory, we also specify if it can delegate</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">We create Task by specifying Task description and expected output</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">We define crew by specifying agents and their tasks</mark>
