# What is LLM

* Foundational that use deep learning models like transformers to process and understand natural data
* These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language
* It is a language model which is responsible for performing tasks such as text to text generation, text to image generation, image to text generation, image to image generation
* A LLM is trained deep learning model (transformer) that understands and generate text in a human like fashion
