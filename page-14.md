# YouTube Videos to Blog using CrewAI Agents

* CrewAI is agent framework
* In Langchain also we can create agents, but here we will be able to create multiple agents which can interact with each other effeciently
* 3 important contents
  * Agents
    * Here content write, domain expert will be our agents here
  * Tasks
  * Tools
*   This is called sequential process â‡’ Once researcher finishes, it gives its output to Content writer to create blogs
