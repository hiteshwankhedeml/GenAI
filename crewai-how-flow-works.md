# CrewAI - How Flow works

* While Crews excel at autonomous collaboration, Flows provide structured automations, offering granular control over workflow execution.&#x20;
* Flows ensure tasks are executed reliably, securely, and efficiently, handling conditional logic, loops, and dynamic state management with precision.&#x20;
* Flows integrate seamlessly with Crews, enabling you to balance high autonomy with exacting control.
