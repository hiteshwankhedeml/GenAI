# Chunking Approaches

1. Length Based:

* Either token/character based

2. Text Structure:

* Paragraph/Sentence

3. Document Structure:

* Different format like markdown, html, code, json
* Based on sections, code we can split

4. Semantic Approach:

* Considers the text of the data
* Approach is to split when there are significant changes in text meaning
