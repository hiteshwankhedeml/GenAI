DL:

* Subset of ML
* Was built to mimic human brain using multilayered neural network
  * ANN
  * CNN and object detection ⇒ Computer vision
  * RNN and its variants ⇒ Text related use cases / time series
    * Transformer and BERT ⇒ GenAI

* DL models are of 2 type - Discriminative and Generative
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**GenAI is about generating content**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**LLM ⇒ Text**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**LIM ⇒ Image**</mark>
* Discriminative AI is about classification / regression

* OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic
* Anthropic claude3 is competitor of GPT4
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They are called foundation model, as they are trained on huge internet data**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**We can use finetuning to use it for domain specific use case**</mark>
