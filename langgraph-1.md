# LangGraph

* We use this framework for agents
* Langchain is framework providing us chat models, embedding model, chaining, prompt templates, vectorDB, loaders, tools etc
* LangGraph has been creating for agentic workflow
  * State
  * Nodes and edges
  * Creation of tools
* Langchain also provided different agentic classes but they thought instead of providing classes lets give to developers authority to create agents etc so they created langGraph
* We use it for orchestration (Workflow /  Pipeline)
* Agents are smart AI assistant which can take action by tool calling
