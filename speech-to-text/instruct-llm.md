# 🟢 Instruct LLM

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**“Instruct LLMs” are large language models that are fine-tuned to follow user instructions precisely.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They start from a base model (trained on general text) and then get instruction-tuning using datasets of**</mark><mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**&#x20;**</mark>_<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**prompt → response**</mark>_<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**&#x20;**</mark><mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**pairs.**</mark>
* The goal is to make the model helpful, safe, deterministic, and aligned with what a user asks.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Examples include Llama-3 Instruct, Mistral Instruct, Gemma-Instruct, OpenAI GPT-Instruct series**</mark>.
* They are optimized for tasks like summarization, translation, extraction, reasoning, coding, Q\&A, etc.
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They avoid unnecessary creativity and try to give direct answers following the user prompt exactly.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They are preferred for enterprise apps because they show predictable behavior compared to base models.**</mark>
