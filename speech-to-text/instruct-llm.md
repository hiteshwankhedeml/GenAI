# Instruct LLM

* “Instruct LLMs” are large language models that are fine-tuned to follow user instructions precisely.
* They start from a base model (trained on general text) and then get instruction-tuning using datasets of _prompt → response_ pairs.
* The goal is to make the model helpful, safe, deterministic, and aligned with what a user asks.
* Examples include Llama-3 Instruct, Mistral Instruct, Gemma-Instruct, OpenAI GPT-Instruct series.
* They are optimized for tasks like summarization, translation, extraction, reasoning, coding, Q\&A, etc.
* They avoid unnecessary creativity and try to give direct answers following the user prompt exactly.
* They are preferred for enterprise apps because they show predictable behavior compared to base models.
