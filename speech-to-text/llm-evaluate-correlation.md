# LLM Evaluate - Correlation

* **Human scores:** 9, 8, 6, 3, 1
* **Model-1 scores:** 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 → **correlation = 0** (model cannot distinguish good vs weak answers)
* **Model-2 scores:** 8, 7, 6, 4, 2 → **correlation ≈ 0.99** (model increases score when humans increase score, so it understands answer quality)
