# 🟡 Need for Two Way Interviews

* Ensures the candidate actually answers the question instead of going off-topic.
* Detects silence, noise, or incomplete answers instantly and retries automatically.
* Allows adaptive interviewing: repeat, follow-up, or move ahead based on answer quality.
* Creates a real conversational experience instead of a one-sided recording.
* Enables clarification questions when the candidate gives vague or partial responses.
* Supports dynamic difficulty adjustment based on candidate performance.
* Improves fairness and consistency by checking relevance in real time.
* Can stop early if the candidate repeatedly fails, saving interviewer time.
* Generates insights and feedback progressively, not just after the interview.
* Simulates the behavior of a real interviewer, increasing engagement and assessment accuracy.
