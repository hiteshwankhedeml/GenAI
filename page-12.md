* To calculate search
* Semantic search is based on cosine similarity
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**c is constant here and depends on DB (Range 0 to 60)**</mark>
* For every document we will calculate score based on semantic rank and keyword rank
* So based on 50% weightage Document 1 will be better
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**We can change weightage also**</mark>
