# Messages

* Messages are the fundamental unit of context for models in LangChain.&#x20;
* They represent the input and output of models, carrying both the content and metadata needed to represent the state of a conversation when interacting with an LLM.&#x20;
* Messages are objects that contain:
  * Role - Identifies the message type (e.g. system, user)
  * Content - Represents the actual content of the message (like text, images, audio, documents, etc.)
  * Metadata - Optional fields such as response information, message IDs, and token usage
* LangChain provides a standard message type that works across all model providers, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the model being called
