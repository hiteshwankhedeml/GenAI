# Human in the Loop

* Review For human-in-the-loop, we often want to see our graph outputs as its running.
* We laid the foundations for this with streaming.

Reasons for human in the loop:

* Approval - We can interrupt our agent, surface state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action
* Debugging - We can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues
* Editing - You can modify the state



* LangGraph offers several ways to get or update agent state to support various human-in-the-loop workflows.
