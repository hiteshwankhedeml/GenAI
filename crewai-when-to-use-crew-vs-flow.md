* **Choose** [**Crews**](https://docs.crewai.com/en/guides/crews/first-crew) **when:** You need autonomous problem-solving, creative collaboration, or exploratory tasks
* **Choose** [**Flows**](https://docs.crewai.com/en/guides/flows/first-flow) **when:** You require deterministic outcomes, auditability, or precise control over execution
* **Combine both when:** Your application needs both structured processes and pockets of autonomous intelligence
