# MCP

* [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
* Idea came from Anthropic
* To make a standardized pattern
* Initially it was through clause desktop, but now we have SDK as well
* MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools
* 2022 - LLMs came - Bit dumb as it does not know the latest things, it is limited to training data&#x20;
* LLM + Agents - Smart solution, there can be lots of tools
* For tools we are highly dependent on REST APIs
* When we are working with LLMs we dont prefer this, as it will cause issue if there is some issue in json schema
* In this scenario, our application will crash
* So it was decided that everyone will follow MCP
* So every provider like booking.com etc will provide their own MCP
