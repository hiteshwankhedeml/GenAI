# Introduction to Tools and Agents

**Tools:**

* Interfaces that an agent, chain or LLM can use to interact with the world
* Model is trained till some date
* There will be current information that we might require

Agents:

* To use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take
* When a query is asked which tools should the agent call? â‡’ OpenAI agents have been fine tuned to select tools as per the query



* Langchain provides end to end ecosystem for this
* We can also use CrewAI for this
