# Question Generation

Same as that done for JD generation

* Based on JD we generated Interview Questions
  * **Technical questions** – to validate depth on skills explicitly mentioned in the JD
  * **Scenario-based questions** – to assess problem-solving and real-world application of those skills
  * **Behavioral questions** – to evaluate ownership, collaboration, and decision-making in the context of the role
* Based on Resume and JD we generate Interview Questions
  * In this we used PII masking
