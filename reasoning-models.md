* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Reasoning models are LLMs optimized for multi-step logical thinking and correctness**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They reason internally before producing a final answer**</mark>
* They are best for math, logic, planning, agents, and evaluation tasks
* They reduce logical errors compared to normal chat models
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They are slower and more expensive than standard LLMs**</mark>
* They are commonly used as judge models in RAG evaluation
* OpenAI o-series, Claude 3.x, Gemini Pro, and large LLaMA variants are examples
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**They are not ideal for simple chat or summarization**</mark>
