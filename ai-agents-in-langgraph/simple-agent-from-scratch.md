# Simple Agent from Scratch

* ReACT pattern - Reasoning + Acting
* LLM first thinks what to do, and then decides action to take
* Action is executed in an environment and an observation is returned
* With this observation, LLM again thinks what to be done next and then takes action
* This is done till LLM decides that it's done
